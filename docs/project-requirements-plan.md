# Valet System PoC - Project Requirements Plan (PRP)

## Executive Summary

The Valet System Proof of Concept (PoC) is a modern web application demonstrating HTTP passthrough architecture using Cloudflare Workers + Containers to proxy requests to a containerized Convex backend running on the edge. This document outlines the comprehensive requirements, technical specifications, and implementation roadmap for building a robust, scalable foundation.

## Project Overview

### Vision
Create a cutting-edge web application framework that leverages the best of modern frontend technologies (React 19, Vite, TypeScript, shadcn/ui) with innovative backend architecture (Cloudflare Workers, Containers, Convex) to demonstrate global edge computing capabilities.

### Core Objectives
- **Performance**: Ultra-fast global delivery through edge computing
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling with Cloudflare's global network
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with hot reload, TypeScript, and component libraries
- **Architecture**: Demonstrate container orchestration and HTTP passthrough patterns
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented codebase following best practices

## Technical Stack Specifications

### Frontend Framework
- **React 19**: Latest React with concurrent features and server components
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for enhanced development experience
- **Vite**: Ultra-fast build tool with hot module replacement
- **shadcn/ui**: Beautiful, accessible component library built on Radix UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

### Backend Architecture
- **Cloudflare Workers**: Edge computing runtime for request routing and processing
- **Cloudflare Containers**: Containerized compute for heavy lifting and custom backends
- **Durable Objects**: Stateful coordination and container lifecycle management
- **Convex**: Real-time backend-as-a-service with built-in authentication

### Development Tools
- **ESLint**: Code linting with React and TypeScript rules
- **Prettier**: Code formatting for consistency
- **Wrangler**: Cloudflare deployment and development CLI
- **Git**: Version control with conventional commits

## Architecture Patterns

### HTTP Passthrough Pattern
```
Browser → Cloudflare Worker → Durable Object → Container → Convex Backend
```

#### Key Components:
1. **Edge Layer (Workers)**: Routing, authentication, caching, rate limiting
2. **Orchestration Layer (Durable Objects)**: Container lifecycle management
3. **Compute Layer (Containers)**: Heavy processing, custom backends
4. **Data Layer (Convex)**: Real-time database, authentication, functions

### Container Integration Patterns
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Workers control routing and authentication before container access
- **Service Mesh Pattern**: Private connections between containers with programmable routing
- **Orchestrator Pattern**: Custom scheduling, scaling, and health checking logic
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Edge handles routing/auth/caching, containers provide substantial compute

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features
1. **Static Asset Serving**: React application served from Cloudflare Workers
2. **API Routing**: `/api/*` routes handled by Worker and proxied to container
3. **Container Management**: Automatic lifecycle management via Durable Objects
4. **Real-time Data**: Convex integration for live data synchronization
5. **Authentication**: Convex Auth integration for user management
6. **Component Library**: shadcn/ui components for consistent UI

### User Stories
- **As a developer**, I want hot reload during development so I can iterate quickly
- **As a user**, I want fast page loads globally so the app feels responsive
- **As an admin**, I want container health monitoring so I can ensure uptime
- **As a developer**, I want TypeScript support so I can catch errors early
- **As a user**, I want beautiful, accessible UI components

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Page Load Time**: < 2 seconds globally (First Contentful Paint)
- **API Response Time**: < 500ms for container-backed APIs
- **Cold Start Time**: < 100ms for Workers, < 5 seconds for containers
- **Throughput**: Handle 10,000+ concurrent requests per region

### Scalability
- **Auto-scaling**: Containers scale to zero when idle
- **Global Distribution**: Deploy to Cloudflare's 300+ edge locations
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 100,000+ simultaneous users
- **Resource Efficiency**: Pay-per-use model with automatic optimization

### Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic encrypted in transit
- **Authentication**: Secure user auth via Convex Auth
- **Input Validation**: All API inputs validated and sanitized
- **Container Isolation**: Secure sandbox environment for containers

### Reliability
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and meaningful error messages
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and observability
- **Backup Strategy**: Data persistence and backup mechanisms

## Development Workflow

### Environment Setup
1. **Local Development**: `npm run dev` with hot reload
2. **Backend Development**: `npm run dev:backend` for Convex development
3. **Container Testing**: Local Docker testing before deployment
4. **Type Checking**: Continuous TypeScript validation

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: `tsc -b && vite build`
2. **Type Generation**: `wrangler types` for Cloudflare bindings
3. **Linting**: `npm run lint` with ESLint rules
4. **Testing**: Automated test suite execution

### Deployment Pipeline
1. **Development**: Automatic preview deployments on PR
2. **Staging**: Integration testing environment
3. **Production**: `npm run deploy` via Wrangler
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time deployment health checks

## Quality Assurance
